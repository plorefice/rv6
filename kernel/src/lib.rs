//! rv6 is an educational, Unix-like kernel inspired by
//! [xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/xv6.html), with a focus on the RISC-V architecture.
//! The goal is to achieve a minimal operating system able to boot a userpace init program.
//!
//! rv6 is developed and tested using [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/). It has not been tested on real
//! hardware and some things may thus not work as expected.

// We are building a freestanding binary, so no standard library support for us
#![no_std]
// Keep things clean and tidy
#![warn(missing_docs)]
// Bunch of features required throughout the kernel code
#![feature(asm, naked_functions)]
#![feature(lang_items)]

#![feature(
    const_raw_ptr_deref,
    const_mut_refs,
    const_fn_fn_ptr_basics,
    const_raw_ptr_to_usize_cast
)]
